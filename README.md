# PHP-SOLID-Principles
 SOLID is an acronym representing five fundamental principles of object-oriented programming:

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - A class should have only one reason to change
    - Each class should handle one specific functionality

2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
    - Use interfaces and abstract classes to enable extensibility

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
    - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
    - Keep interfaces small and focused

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
    - Both should depend on abstractions

This repository contains examples demonstrating these principles in PHP.
